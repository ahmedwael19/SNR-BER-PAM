# CIE327 - SNR and BER for different PAM

1. Calculate the bit error rate (BER) for different PAM levels either with additive white gaussian noise (AWGN) or without.
2. Calculate and plot in semilog scale the signal to noise ratio (SNR) for different PAM levels.


This code is developed for the probability and stochastic processes in Spring 2018
